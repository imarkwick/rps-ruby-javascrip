# Superhero Javascript

This was the first week of learning javascript at Makers Academy. 

The challenge was to pair program and produce a rock, paper, lizard, spock game on Heroku.

My pair's version was a superhero game against the computer, where players could choose:
- Iron Man
- Hulk
- Black Widow
- Thor
- Spiderman

The results of who beats who is displayed on a separate 'Rules' page.

To view tests, clone the repo and run SpecRunner from the command line;

```sh
$ open SpecRunner.html
```

To open in the browser and play superhero rock paper scissors, use the rackup command and visit localhost/9292;

```sh
$ rackup
```
